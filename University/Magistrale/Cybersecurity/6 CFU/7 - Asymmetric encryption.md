# Asymmetric encryption: the Diffie-Hellman intuition
now we talked always about symmetric keys. Now we think in a different way: a asymmetric encryption: the tipical usage is different because it is harder to guarantee Confidentiality.


## Reminder about the model
![[Pasted image 20251022151244.png]]
if keys𝐾1 = 𝐾2 symmetric encryption
else asymmetric

remember: encryption doesn't provide only Confidentiality but also other properties.

## Another definition

- **Key exchange** is the process of establishing a shared symmetric key between two parties over an insecure communication channel
	- classic challenge in enabling private communication between remote parties
	- the part of key exchange is extremely important and there are many protocols used in those situations.
- **Asymmetric** cryptography provides a solution to this problem by enabling secure key exchange mechanisms

## Public-key encryption

A relevant example of asymmetric encryption
- when K 1 ≠K 2
is the **public-key encryption**. Note that:
- public key encryption $\Rightarrow$ Asymmetric encryption
- Asymmetric encryption $\nRightarrow$ public key encryption

purposes
- integrity and non-repudiation
- key exchange
    - main example that requires confidentiality


## Diffie and Hellman [1976]  “New Directions in Cryptography”

Split the Bob’s secret key K into two parts

- $K_E$ to be used for encrypting messages to Bob
- $K_D$ to be used for decrypting messages by Bob
- $K_E$ can (must) be made public
    - essence of public key cryptography a type of
       asymmetric cryptography

I can also encrypt also with the other key and viceversa with the other one. 

Other people will use your public key, and you can decrypt easily.
If i encrypt with my private key, who can encrypt? EVERYONE. that's why there is not confidentiality.
but because you are the only one who can encrypt a message, so i'm the owner, everyone that can decrypt can be sure that the message is made by me (**NO REPUDIATION**, even stronger than **Autenticity**).

I can use the asymmetric key to share the symmetric key: i use the public key to encrypt the symmetric key and then i can create a secret communication channel.

## Number of keys
Imagine each node is a Spy. if we consider a complete graph, how many arches do we have? consider n spies, each spy has n-1 arcs, then we have n(n-1)/2, where the /2 is because when i consider another spy, i compute an exact same arch of another spy
- if arc(spy1,spy2) == arch(spy2, spy1)
![[Pasted image 20251022152451.png]]
Today we say that a pair of keys (private, public) is associated with each actor
- linear number of asymmetric keys
- quadratic number of symmetric keys


## “New Directions in Cryptography” • The Diffie-Hellman paper [IEEE Transactions on Information

```
Theory, vol. IT-22, Nov. 1976] generated lot of interest in
crypto research, both in academia and private industry
http://www-ee.stanford.edu/%7Ehellman/publications/24.pdf
```
- Diffie & Hellman produced the revolutionary idea of public key cryptography, but did not have a proposed implementation (this came up two years later with Merkle-Hellman and Rivest-Shamir-Adelman)
- **In their '76 paper, Diffie & Hellman did invent a method for key exchange over insecure communication lines, a method that is still in use today**

## Excerpt from RSA paper

- Historical paper: "A Method for Obtaining Digital
    Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems
    R.L. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman", Communications of the ACM 21,
    1978 https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf
- ***The era of electronic mail may soon be upon us*** _; we must ensure that_
    _two important properties of the current paper mail system are preserved: (a)_
    _messages areprivate, and (b) messages can besigned. We demonstrate in_
    _this paper how to build these capabilities into an electronic mail system._
- _At the heart of our proposal is a new encryption method. This method_
    _provides an implementation of a public-key cryptosystem, an elegant_
    _concept invented by Diffie and Hellman [1]. Their article motivated our_
    _research, since they presented the concept but not any practical_
    _implementation of such a system. Readers familiar with [1] may wish to skip_
    _directly to Section V for a description of our method._


## Meaning of encryption

Alice **encrypts**

- by Bob's public key
    - although public it must be known
    - all can use Bob's public key
    - **confidentiality**
- by Alice's private key
    - only Alice can use it
    - everybody can decrypt
    - no confidentiality, but **path to non-repudiation**


## Encryption behaviour

- What is encrypted by a public key can be decrypted by the associated private key

- What is encrypted by a private key can be decrypted by the associated public key
	- This happens for RSA (later)
- This perfect symmetry causes the frequent use of the term encryption for both (classic) encryption and decryption

>A function 𝑓: 0,1 ∗→ 0,1 ∗is called a one-way function (OWF) if it is

**cryptographic hashing functions are OWF**
## Integer multiplication & factoring as an OWF
![[Pasted image 20251023113341.png]]
**Q.: Can a public key system be based? on this observation**

## Integer multiplication

- given x, y, two large prime numbers of roughly equal bit-length (say, n bits each)
- computing z =xy, 2n bits, is easy
    - many poly algs
- no poly alg is know for factoring z
    - Shor is poly on quantum computers


## Discrete Log (DL)

- Let G be a finite cyclic group with n elements and g a generator of G
- Let y be any element in G; then it can be written as $y= g^x$, for some integer x
- Let $y = g^x$ and $x$ the minimal non-negative integer satisfying the equation
- The minimal x s.t. $y = g^x$ is called the **discrete log of** **y to base g**
- Example: $y = g^x$ mod p in the multiplicative group of ℤp


## Modular exponentiation

- `c mod p = (a ⋅ b) mod p = ((a mod p) ⋅ (b mod p)) mod p`

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic#Properties
- be mod p =(b mod p)$^{e mod𝜑(p)}$ mod p
	- p prime and (b,p) co-prime
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem
- can use mod on partial results


## Fast mod exponentiation
```c
long fastModExp(unsigned int base, unsigned int exp, long mod) {
	long result = 1;
	long b = base % mod;
	while (exp > 0) {
		if (exp & 1)
		result = (result * b) % mod;
		b = (b * b) % mod;
		exp >>= 1;
	}
	return result;
}
```

## #### Discrete Log in ℤ

∗

#### 𝒑 : a

#### candidate as OWF

- Let𝑦 = 𝑔𝑥 mod 𝑝 inℤ∗𝑝
    - e.g.,ℤ∗ 10 = 1,3,7,9  (𝑝is not necessarily prime)
- 𝑔𝑥 mod 𝑝can be computed in O(log 𝑥) multiplications, each
    multiplication taking O(log^2 𝑝) steps (remind𝑔 < 𝑝)
       - also, it turns out𝑥must be< 𝑝 ⟹overall # of steps is
          O(log^3 𝑝)
- Standard discrete log is believed to be computationally hard
- 𝑥  𝑔𝑥 mod 𝑝  is believed to be an OWF
    - 𝑥𝑔𝑥 mod 𝑝 is easy (efficiently computable)
    - 𝑔𝑥 mod 𝑝  𝑥believed hard (computationally infeasible)
- This is acomputation-basednotion


#### Do OWFs exist?

- open problem
    - they are conjectured to exist
- **Theorem**. If a one-way function
    exists, then P ≠ NP (theoretical proof)
    - one-way functions are conjectured
       to exist, as P is conjectured to be
       strictly included in NP


#### Utility of OWFs

- Cryptographic hashing (and its uses),
    secure key exchanges, public key
    cryptography, random numbers...
- More generally, assuming OWFs exist, we
    obtain strong mathematical properties that
    are computationally **hard to break** ,
    forming the foundation of many
    cryptographic guarantees


##### Diffie-Hellman

##### key exchange


#### Public exchange of keys

- Goal: two parties (Alice and Bob) who do not share
    any secret information, perform a protocol and derive
    the same shared key
- Eve, who is listening, cannot obtain the new shared
    key if she has limited computational resources (i.e. in
    polynomial time)
       - unless P = NP


#### DH procedure

- Public parameters: a prime𝑝, and an element 𝑔(possibly a
    generator of the multiplicative groupℤ∗𝑝)
       - better a safe prime, i.e., a prime 𝑝 = 2𝑞 + 1 where 𝑞is
          also prime (a Sophie Germain prime)
- Alice chooses 𝑎at random from the interval
    [1..𝑝−1] and sends𝑔𝑎mod 𝑝 to Bob
- Bob chooses𝑏 at random from the interval
    [1..𝑝−1] and sends𝑔𝑏mod 𝑝 to Alice
- Alice and Bob compute the shared key 𝑔𝑎𝑏mod 𝑝
    - Bob holds 𝑏, computes 𝑔𝑎 𝑏𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑝 = 𝑔𝑎𝑏 mod 𝑝
    - Alice holds 𝑎, computes 𝑔𝑏 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑝 = 𝑔𝑎𝑏 mod 𝑝


#### DH procedure – visual


#### Terminology

- **Public parameters** (𝑔 and 𝑝)
- **Private keys** (𝑎 and 𝑏): they are secret
- **Public keys** (𝐴 = 𝑔𝑎mod 𝑝 and 𝐴 = 𝑔𝑎mod 𝑝):

```
public
```
- **Shared secret sey** (𝐾 = 𝑔𝑎𝑏mod 𝑝)


#### DH and MITM

1. A->T(B):𝑔𝑎mod 𝑝
2. T(B)->A:𝑔𝑡mod 𝑝 _(t chosen by T)_
3. T(A)->B:𝑔𝑡mod 𝑝
4. B->T(A):𝑔𝑏mod 𝑝

Effects

- B shares a key 𝑔𝑏𝑡mod 𝑝 with T (believing to share it with
    A)
- A shares a key 𝑔𝑎𝑡mod 𝑝 with T (believing to share it with
    B)


#### Perfect forward secrecy

The cryptosystem

- generates random public keys per session for the
    purposes of key agreement, and
- does not use any sort of deterministic algorithm in doing so

**The compromise of a shared key does not compromise
former, or subsequent, shared keys**

#### MITM and static DH

- MITM can be prevented by inserting key material
    within X509 certificates
- Used in authentication
- To be developed later


#### Properties of key exchange

```
Necessary security requirement: the shared secret key is
a one-way function of the public and transmitted
information
```
```
Necessary “constructive” requirement: an appropriate
combination of public and private pieces of information
forms the shared secret key efficiently
```
```
DH Key exchange by itself is effective only against a
passive adversary. Man-in-the-middle attack is lethal
```

#### Security requirements

- Is the one-way relationship between public
    information and shared private key sufficient?
- A one-way function may leak some bits of its
    arguments: this is prevented by carefully
    choosing g and p
- The full requirement is: given all the
    communication recorded throughout the
    protocol, computing any bit of the shared key
    is hard
- Note that the “any bit” requirement is
    especially important


#### Other DH Systems

- The DH idea can be used with any group
    structure
- Limitation: groups in which the discrete log can be
    easily computed are not useful (for example:
    additive group of Zp)
- Currently useful DH systems: ECDH, the
    multiplicative group of Zp and elliptic curve
    systems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-
    curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman
- Keys are exchanged in most network protocols,
    refreshed, automatically distributed, etc.

#### The multiplicative group ℤ

```
∗
𝒑𝒒
```
- Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be two large primes. Denote their
    product 𝑁 = 𝑝𝑞
- The multiplicative group ℤ∗𝑵 contains all integers
    in the range [1,𝑝𝑞−1] that are relatively prime to
    both 𝑝 and 𝑞
- Since in [1,𝑝𝑞−1] there are (𝑝−1) multiples of 𝑞 and
    (𝑞−1) multiples of 𝑝, the size of the group is
    φ(𝑝𝑞) = 𝑝𝑞−1−(𝑝−1)−(𝑞−1) = 𝑝𝑞−(𝑝 + 𝑞) + 1 = (𝑝−
    1)(𝑞−1)
- By Euler’s theorem, for 𝑥∈ℤ∗𝑁, 𝑥 𝑝−1 𝑞−1 = 1

- Let 𝑝 and 𝑞 be two large primes. Denote their
    product 𝑁 = 𝑝𝑞
- The multiplicative group ℤ∗𝑵 contains all integers
    in the range [1,𝑝𝑞−1] that are relatively prime to
    both 𝑝 and 𝑞
- Since in [1,𝑝𝑞−1] there are (𝑝−1) multiples of 𝑞 and
    (𝑞−1) multiples of 𝑝, the size of the group is
    φ(𝑝𝑞) = 𝑝𝑞−1−(𝑝−1)−(𝑞−1) = 𝑝𝑞−(𝑝 + 𝑞) + 1 = (𝑝−
    1)(𝑞−1)
- By Euler’s theorem, for 𝑥∈ℤ∗𝑁, 𝑥 𝑝−1 𝑞−1 = 1


#### Exponentiation in ℤ

```
∗
𝒑𝒒
```
- We want to exponentiatefor encryption.
- Not all integers in {1,2,...𝑝𝑞−1} belong to ℤ∗𝑝𝑞.
    - These elements do not necessarily have a
       unique inverse in ℤ∗𝑝𝑞
- Let 𝑒 be an integer, 1 < 𝑒 < (𝑝−1)(𝑞−1)
- **Question: when is exponentiation to the** 𝒆 **-th**

```
power, 𝒙 → 𝒙𝒆 , a one-to-one oper. in ℤ∗𝑝𝑞?
```

#### 𝒑𝒒 -

- **detailsClaim** : If 𝑒 is relatively prime to 𝑝−1 𝑞−1  then 𝑥 ⟶
    𝑥𝑒 is a one-to-one op. in ℤ∗𝒑𝒒
- **Constructive proof** : Since gcd (𝑒, (𝑝−1)(𝑞−1)) = 1, 𝑒
    has a multiplicative inverse mod (𝑝−1)(𝑞−1)
- Denote it by 𝑑, then 𝑒𝑑 = 1 + 𝐶(𝑝−1)(𝑞−1), 𝐶 constant
- Let 𝑦 = 𝑥𝑒, then 𝑦𝑑 = 𝑥𝑒 𝑑 = 𝑥1+𝐶 𝑝−1 𝑞−1 =

𝑥^1 𝑥𝐶 𝑝−1 𝑞−1 = 𝑥 𝑥 𝑝−1 𝑞−1

    QED


39

#### RSA public key

- **cryptosystem** Let 𝑁 = 𝑝𝑞 be the product of two primes
- Choose 1 < 𝑒 < 𝜑(𝑁) such that gcd 𝑒, 𝜑 𝑁 = 1
- Let 𝑑 be such that 𝑑𝑒 ≡ 1 𝑚𝑜𝑑 φ(𝑁)
- The public key is (𝑒,𝑁)
- The private key is (𝑑, 𝑁)
- Encryption of 𝑀∈ℤ𝑁 by 𝐶 = 𝐸(𝑀) = 𝑀𝑒 mod 𝑁
- Decryption of 𝐶∈ℤ𝑁 by 𝑀 = 𝐷(𝐶) = 𝐶𝑑 mod 𝑁
The above-mentioned method should not be confused with
the exponentiation technique presented by Diffie and
Hellman to solve the key distribution problem


40

#### Why decryption works

- Since𝑒𝑑 ≡ 1 (mod φ), there is integer𝑘s.t.
    𝑒𝑑 = 1 + 𝑘𝜑,𝜑 = (𝑝−1)(𝑞−1)
- Ifgcd (𝑚, 𝑝) = 1then (by Fermat)𝑚𝑝−1≡ 1 (mod 𝑝)
- raise both sides to the power𝑘(𝑞−1)and then multiply both sides
    by𝑚, and get
       𝑚1+𝑘(𝑝−1)(𝑞−1)= 𝑚𝑒𝑑≡ 𝑚 (mod 𝑝)
- Ifgcd (𝑚, 𝑝) = 𝑝(no other possibilities!) then the last congruence
    still holds because both sides congruent to 0  mod 𝑝, because𝑚 =
    𝑗𝑝, for some 𝑗 ≥ 1(𝑚is multiple of𝑝)
- Hence, in both cases,𝑚𝑒𝑑 ≡ 𝑚 (mod 𝑝)
- Similarly,𝑚𝑒𝑑 ≡ 𝑚 (mod 𝑞)
- Sincegcd (𝑝, 𝑞) = 1, it follows (by Chinese Remainder Theorem)
    𝑚𝑒𝑑 ≡ 𝑚 (mod 𝑁)


41

#### RSA

- key length is variable
    - the longer, the higher security
    - 2048-4096 bits are common
- block size also variable
    - but |plaintext| ≤ |N|(in practice, for avoiding weak cases,
       |plaintext| < |N|)
    - |ciphertext| = |N|
- note that plaintext and ciphertext are numbers < N
- slower than symmetric ciphers
    - not used in practice for encrypting long messages
    - mostly used to encrypt a symmetric key, then used for
       encrypting the message
          - key exchange


##### RSA – an

##### example


#### Historical note

- The original paper presented an example by
    exchanging𝑑 and𝑒
- This is not relevant because the two keys have the
    same behaviour
- You can use any of the two keys for encrypting and
    the other key for decrypting
- You can choose any key to be the private one, then
    the other will be the public one
       - Or vice versa
- In the example that follows we restore the use of 𝑒 and
    𝑑 to match what we have presented


#### Multiplicative inverses

- The Extended Euclidean algorithm is used
- Based on **Bézout's identity** : given two non-zero integers 𝑥
    and 𝑦 there exist signed integers 𝑎and 𝑏 such that 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏𝑦 =
    gcd (𝑥,𝑦)
- If 𝑥 and 𝑦 are **coprime** then 𝒂𝒙 + 𝒃𝒚 = 𝟏
    - Key for computing multiplicative inverses
    - 𝑎𝑥 = 1−𝑏𝑦
    - Apply to both sides mod 𝑦
    - 𝑎𝑥 ≡ 1 (mod 𝑦) (since 𝑏𝑦 ≡ 0 (mod 𝑦))
    - 𝑎 ≡ 𝑥−1 (mod 𝑦) and (similarly) 𝑏 ≡ 𝑦−1 (mod 𝑥)
- Remember: multiplicative inverses are equivalence classes


#### Overview on the Extended

#### Euclidean Algorithm EEA

- Classical Euclid's algorithm can be extended to
    maintain the equality 𝑢𝑖𝑥 + 𝑣𝑖𝑦 = 𝑟𝑖
- At the end, 𝑟𝑘 = 1 (for some 𝑘)
    - equality converges to Bézout's identity
- Construction is based on correct initialization
- Maintenance of equality can be obtained by suitable
    update of non-constant values and proved by
    induction


46

#### The EEA algorithm

```
function extendedEuclid(a, b)
// Assumes gcd(a, b) = 1
x0 ← 1, y0 ← 0
x1 ← 0, y1 ← 1
```
```
while b ≠ 0
q ← a div b
(a, b) ← (b, a mod b)
(x0, x1) ← (x1, x0 - q * x1)
(y0, y1) ← (y1, y0 - q * y1)
```
```
return (x0, y0) // such that a*x0 + b*y0 = 1
```

47

#### A small example

- Let p = 47, q = 59, N = pq = 2773
    - φ(N)= 46×58 = 2668
- Pick e = 157 (gcd(2668, 157) = gcd(157, 156) = gcd(156, 1) =
    gcd(1, 0) = 1), then 157×17 – 2668 = 1, so d = 17 is the inverse of
    157 mod 2668
- For N = 2773 we can encode two letters per block, using a two-digit
    number per letter:
- blank = 00, A = 01, B = 02, ..., Z = 26
- Message: ITS ALL GREEK TO ME is encoded
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

#### A small example

- N = 2773, e = 17
- ITS ALL GREEK TO ME is encoded as
    0920 1900 0112 1200 0718 0505 1100 2015 0013 0500
- First block M = 0920 encrypts to
    - Me= M^17 = (((M^2 )^2 )^2 )^2 ×M = 948 (mod 2773)
- The whole message (10 blocks) is encrypted as
    0948 2342 1084 1444 2663 2390 0778 0774 0219 1655
- Indeed 0948d = 0948^157 = 9481+4+8+16+128 = 920 (mod 2773), etc.


#### Choice of exponents

- Each of the two exponents can be chosen at random
    - as long as coprime to (𝑝−1)(𝑞−1) = 𝜑
- The other exponent is its multiplicative inverse mod 𝜑
- First exponent is often chosen small (e.g., 65537)
    - good for the public exponent


##### RSA –

##### purposes of

##### encryption


#### RSA: two ways for

- Recall the existence of two keys **encrypting**
    - public
    - private
- Depending on which key is used, RSA encryption
    behaves differently
- Alice encrypts a block M using
    - Bob's public key (any public key can be
       used)
    - Alice's private key (only the owner can use
       their private key)


#### RSA: effects

- Encryption by a public key
    - everybody can encrypt by using a pub key
    - only the owner of the corresponding private
       key can decrypt
    - confidentiality
- Encryption by a private key
    - only the owner can encrypt
    - everybody can decrypt
    - no confidentiality
    - non-repudiation?


#### Non-repudiation

- The sender of a message cannot deny
    having sent it
- It provides proof of origin and integrity
- Typically reached through a digital
    signature
- HMAC doesn't provide non-repudiation
    - A judge can't attribute the message to
       one of the parties sharing the HMAC
       key


#### Purposes

- Enc with pub key
    - confidentiality
    - mainly used for key-exchange
    - not used for messages longer than
       one block (or ≥ N)
- End with pvt key
    - integrity, authenticity
    - non-repudiation


#### Discussion (confidentiality)

- RSA is not used to encrypt long files because it
    is inefficient and insecure for that purpose.
    Instead, RSA is typically used for key exchange
    (or digital signatures)
       - Perfomarce issues. Symmetric ciphers
          much faster
       - Size limitation. Number should be < N
       - Security. RSA is deterministic unless
          padded
       - Battery draining
- Hybrid encryption. Key exchange + AES
    - Only few bits are encrypted


#### Discussion (non-

#### repudiation)

- Disregarding the performance issues,

```
RSA enc with pvt key is a path to non-
repudiation
```
- Because public can repeatedly decrypt a

```
message and see that it was originated
by who encrypted
```
- the process is a verification, like
    MAC verification


#### Not yet non-repudiation

Existential forgery example

- Let 𝑈 and 𝑉 respectively be public and
    private key of Alice
- Imagine that we expect non-repudiation if
    Alice sends pair (𝑀,𝑆) where 𝑆 = 𝐸𝑉(𝑀)
- Everybody can verify that 𝐸𝑈(𝑆) = 𝑀 and
    understand that Alice sent the pair
       - recall that in RSA enc & dec are same
          op


#### Forgery

- Fran (attacker) creates a random binary file 𝑅
    - many implementation details missing
- Fran computes 𝐷 = 𝐸𝑈(𝑅)
- Fran (pretending to be Alice) sends to Bob pair
    (𝐷,𝑅)
- Bob verifies and checks that 𝐷 = 𝐸𝑈(𝑅)
- Even if 𝐷 is meaningless the existential forgery
    is successful
       - Bob got direction to accept
       - Whatever file can be interpreted as a
          sequence of integers


#### RSA signature

- Alice sends pair (𝑀,𝐸𝑉(𝐻(𝑀)), where 𝐻 is

```
cryptographic hashing function
```
- Previous attack doesn't work because 𝐻 is OWF
    - Fran cannot get a message to send
- Encrypting a hashing is not demanding because of its
    small size

#### "textbook" RSA is not

#### always robust

- There are several vulnerabilities in the original
    definition of RSA
- Let's examine the main


#### Attacks on RSA

1. Factor N = pq. This is believed hard unless p, q have
    some “bad” properties. To avoid such primes, it is
    recommended to
       - Take p, q large enough (at least ~1024 bits each)
       - Make sure p, q are not too close together
       - Make sure both (p-1), (q-1) have large prime factors
          (to foil Pollard’s rho algorithm)
             - special-purpose integer factorization algorithm
                (John Pollard, 1975); particularly effective at
                splitting composite numbers with small factors.
2. Some messages might be easy to decrypt


#### RSA and factoring

- Fact 1: given N, e, pand q it is easy to compute d
- Fact 2: given N, e
    - if you factor N then you can compute φ(N) and d
- Conclusion
    - If you can factor N, then you break RSA
    - If you invert RSA, then you can factor N?
       OPEN PROBLEM


#### Factoring RSA challenges

- RSA challenges: factor N = pq
- RSA Security has published factoring challenges
    - RSA 426 bits, 129 digits: factorized in 1994 (8
       months, 1600 computers on the Internet (10000
       Mips))
    - RSA 576 bits, 173 digits: factorized in dec. 2003,
       $10000
    - RSA 640 bits, Nov. 2005, 30 2.2GHz-Opteron-CPU
- Challenge is not active anymore (2007)


#### A case study

- June 2008: Kaspersky Labs analyzed a variant of the Gpcode
    ransomware that used RSA encryption with a 1024-bit key to
    lock victims’ files
- Kaspersky proposed a global distributed computing effort to
    break the key. Estimate (from their website):
       - ~15 million modern computers
       - Running for ~1 year
       - To factor a single 1024-bit RSA modulus
- This estimate was theoretical only—no such project was
    launched
- Result: The RSA key was not broken. Victims could only
    recover files via backups or by paying ransom
- The case illustrated the practical strength of RSA-1024 (as of
    2008) against classical brute-force factoring


#### RSA - Attacks

- There are messages m easy to decrypt:
    if m = 0, 1, N-1 then RSA(m) = m
       - notice e must be odd ≥ 3, hence (N-1)e mod N
          ≡ N-1, because (N-1)^2 mod N ≡ 1
       - SOLUT: rare, use salt
- If both m and e are small (e.g., e = 3) then we
    might have me < N; hence me mod N = me
       - compute e-th root in arithmetic is easy:
          adversary compute it and finds m
       - SOLUT. Add nonzero bytes to avoid small
          messages


#### RSA - Attacks

Small e (e.g., e = 3)
❑ Suppose adversary has two encryptions of similar
messages such as
c 1 = m^3 mod n and c 2 = (m+1)^3 mod n
Therefore
m = (c 2 + 2 c 1 - 1) / (c 2 - c 1 +2)
❑ The case m and (am + b) is similar

SOLUT. Choose large e


_1996 Eurocrypt_


#### Some attacks use CRT

**Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**

- Suppose n 1 , n 2 , ..., nk are positive integers which
    are pairwise coprime. Then, for any given
    integers a 1 , a 2 , ..., ak, there exists an integer x
    solving the system of simultaneous congruencies
- Furthermore, all solutions x to this system are
    congruent modulo the product N = n 1 n 2 ...nk


#### RSA - Attacks

- Assume e = 3 and then send the same message three
    times to three different users, with public keys
       (3, n 1 ) (3, n 2 ) (3, n 3 )
- **Attack** : adv. knows public keys and
    m^3 mod n 1 , m^3 mod n 2 , m^3 mod n 3
- He can compute (using CRT)
    m^3 mod (n 1 ∙n 2 ∙n 3 )
- Moreover m < n 1 , n 2 , n 3 ; hence m^3 < n 1 ∙n 2 ∙n 3 and
    m^3 mod n 1 ∙n 2 ∙n 3 = m^3
- Adv. computes cubic root and gets result
- SOLUT. Add random bytes to avoid equal messages


#### RSA - Attacks

- If message space is small, then adv. can test all
    possible messages
       - ex.: adv. knows encoding of m and knows that m
          is either m 1 =10101010 or m 2 =01010101
       - adv. encrypts m 1 and m 2 using public key and
          verifies
- SOLUT. Add random string in the message


73

#### RSA - Attacks

- If two user have same n (but different e and d) then
    bad
       - One user could compute p and q starting from
          his e, d, n (somewhat tricky, based on Euler’s
          theorem – see for instance “The Handbook of
          Applied Cryptography”, Sect. 8.2.2)
       - Then, the user could easily discover the secret
          key of the other user, given his public key
- SOLUT. Each person chooses his own n (the
    probability two people choose same n is very very low)


#### Discussion

- Many mitigations follow similar patterns
- Additional attacks will be discussed later
- These considerations highlight the necessity of
    preprocessing messages before RSA encryption
       - In cryptographic contexts, this preprocessing is
          referred to as padding


##### Other attacks

##### to RSA


#### Multiplicative property and

#### malleability

- In cryptography a function 𝑓 is said to have a
    multiplicative homomorphism (or simply be
    multiplicative) if 𝑓 𝑚 1 ∙𝑚 2 ≡ 𝑓 𝑚 1 ∙𝑓 𝑚 2  mod 𝑛
- This is true for RSA encryption: RSA 𝑚 1 ∙𝑚 2 =
    RSA 𝑚 1 ∙RSA 𝑚 2
- This property is what makes RSA **malleable** : an
    attacker can modify a ciphertext in a predictable
    way without knowing the plaintext, by exploiting
    this multiplicative behavior


#### Attacks on RSA

❑ Multiplicative property of RSA:
❑ If M =M1*M2 then (M1*M2)e mod N=
((M1e mod N) * (M2e mod N) )mod N
Hence an adversary can proceed using small
messages (chosen ciphertext, see next slide)

```
❑ Can be generalized if M= M1*M2* ...*Mk
❑ Solut.: padding on short messages
```

#### Attacks on RSA

Adversarywants to decrypt C = Me mod n

1. adv. computes X = (C∙2e) mod n
2. adv. uses X as chosen ciphertextand asks the oracle for Y
    = Xd mod n
but....
X = (C mod n)∙(2e mod n) = (Me mod n)∙(2emod n) = = (2M)e
    mod n
thus adv. got Y = (2M)


#### Attacks on RSA

Chosen ciphertext attack (more general):

❑ Adv. T knows c = Me mod n
❑ T randomly chooses X and computes
c’ = c Xemod n and ASKS ORACLE TO
DECRYPT c’
❑ T computes (c’)d = c d (X e) d = M X mod n!!
❑ SOLUT: require that messages verify a given structure
(oracle does not answers if M does not verify requirements)


#### Attacks on RSA

Implementation attacks

❑ Timing: based on time required to compute Cd

❑ Energy: based on energy required to compute
(smart card) Cd

❑ Solut.: add random steps in implementation


#### RSA - Attacks : conclusion

Textbook implementation of RSA is NOT safe

❑ It does not verify security criteria

❑ Many attacks

There exists a standard version

❑ Preprocess (pad) M to obtain M’ and apply RSA
to M’ (clearly the meaning of M e M’ is the same)

#### PKCS #1 (old version)

Standard to send message M using RSA. The result of

padding is m

**m = 0 ║ 2 ║ at least 8 non-zero bytes ║ 0 ║ M**

- first byte 0 implies message is less than N
- second byte (= 2) denotes encrypting of a message (1
    denotes non-repudiation use)
- random bytes imply
    - same message sent to many people is always
       different
    - space of messages is large

# PKCS #5 —

# Password-based

# encryption (PBE)


#### PKCS #5 – Motivation

- Users can remember passwords, but not long
    cryptographic keys
- A secure method is needed to derive keys from
    passwords
- Passwords have low entropy and require strengthening
    (e.g., with PBKDFs such as PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt,
    Argon2)


#### PKCS #5 – Applications

- Wi-Fi (WPA/WPA2) uses PBKDF2 to derive the
    Pairwise Master Key
- Password managers (e.g., KeePass, 1Password) rely
    on PBKDF2
- PKCS #12 protects private keys using password-based
    encryption
- Modern KDFs (e.g., Argon2) build on concepts
    introduced in PKCS #5


#### PKCS #5 – Mechanism

- Key derivation via PBKDF1 (legacy) and PBKDF2
    (standard)
- Inputs: password, salt, iteration count, pseudorandom
    function (e.g., HMAC-SHA256)
- Output: derived cryptographic key (suitable for
    encryption or authentication)
       - Example: PBKDF2(password, salt, iterations,
          dkLen)

- Examples of attributes
    - challengePassword (used in PKCS #10 CSR for
       renewal/revocation)
    - emailAddress, unstructuredName
    - Custom attributes via Object Identifiers (OIDs)
- Importance
    - Enable richer identity representation in certificates
    - Still used in CSRs and directories (X.500/X.509)


# PKCS #11 —

# Cryptoki API


#### Cryptoki (PKCS #11)

- Stands for “Crypto Key API”
- Standard C API for interacting with
    - HSMs (Hardware Security Modules)
    - Smart cards, USB tokens
- Architecture
    - Slot = interface/reader
    - Token = cryptographic device
    - Session = active connection
    - Objects = keys, certs, data

- Digital signatures, TLS termination with HSMs
- Smart card logins (Windows, Linux)
- Still evolving: adoption in cloud HSMs and modern key
    management


## PKCS #12 —

## Personal

## information

## exchange


#### PKCS #12 — Purpose &

#### structure

- Defines a container format to bundle certificates, private
    keys, and related data
- Per-object protection: private keys can be encrypted using
    PKCS #5 PBE
- Container-level protection: the entire PFX file can also be
    password-encrypted
- PFX (Personal Information Exchange) container
- Contains “safe bags” (logical containers)
    - certBag (certificates)
    - keyBag (private keys)
    - CRLBag (revocation lists)

    and other tools


## PKCS #15 —

## Cryptographic

## token information

## format


#### PKCS #15 — Overview

- Goal: standardize file structure on cryptographic tokens,
    ensure interoperability across vendors
- Token: hardware or software container holding cryptographic
    material (e.g., smart card, USB token, HSM, virtual token)
- Objects on token: keys (private/public), certificates,
    PINs/authentication data, access control structures
- Applications: eID cards, passports, healthcare cards,
    enterprise access cards
- In practice
    - PKCS #15 = storage format (how data is structured on
       token)
    - PKCS #11 = access interface (how applications use the
       token)

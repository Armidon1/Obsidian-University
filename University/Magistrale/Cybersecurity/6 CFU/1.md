## Scytale cipher

![[Pasted image 20251022145339.png]]
Sparta, 700 BCE
a strip of parchment was wrapped around a wooden rod, and the message was written lengthwise
to decrypt, recipient needed a rod of same diameter

## The Egyptian pharaoh approach
**The sender**
1) Shaving a slave's hexadecimal
2) Carving the secret message into the skull
3) Waiting for the hair to grow black-box
4) Sending the slave to the recipient
**The recipient**
5) Knows he must shave slave's hexadecimal
6) After that, he could access the message

Timescales not comparable to today's

## Enigma

12

one of the most advanced ciphers among the ancients (WWII)
it encrypted each letter by passing it through a series of rotating electrical rotors, producing a different substitution with every keystroke
broken by allied at Bletchley Park

# Slide 13

## Conclusion

Many other examples are possible
In all examples sender and recipient must share some information
We call this shared information the Key (still today)

## Frequency of letters	

15

Each language has its own distribution of frequencies of the letters used
they change from language to language but are public and well-known (Wikipedia)

English

# Slide 16

## Languages

16

They are typically public and available on the web
Several online resources exist
How to do it yourself
  - Take a large sample of text
  - Remove spaces, punctuation, and special symbols
  - Sort the remaining sequence of letters
  - Perform a simple block-based count


How to obtain frequencies

---

# Slide 17

## Frequency analysis(simplified)

17

Clean encrypted text

Normalize casing (all lowercase or uppercase)

Compute basic frequencies

Count the frequency of each individual character

---

# Slide 18

## Frequency analysis(simplified) (2)

18

Use known frequency profiles from major languages

Try aligning the most frequent letters of the encrypted text to each of these and see which language yields the most plausible results

---

# Slide 19

## Frequency analysis(simplified) (3)

19

Look for language-specific patterns
  - common letter pairs (like TH, QU, CH, LL) or letter positions (e.g., Q followed by U is common in many languages)
  - common word lengths (e.g., 2-letter words in English: it, is, to)
  - repeated short patterns like la, le, de (Romance languages), or endings like -en, -er (Germanic languages)

# Slide 30

## What is in attack?

30

Any intentional attempt to compromise the security of a computer system, network, or data by violating one or more core principles of information security, such as confidentiality, integrity, or availability 
Some attacks do not directly target information security principles but serve indirect purposes, such as enabling future compromise or gathering intelligence 
Remember, cryptography plays a fundamental role among the measures designed to uphold information security

# Slide 31

## First attacks

31

---

# Slide 32

## Attacks may use an oracle

32

An oracle is a theoretical black-box function that an attacker can query to obtain outputs (e.g., ciphertexts or plaintexts), often under controlled conditions 

It is an abstract entity or mechanism that provides access to a cryptographic function without revealing its internal workings

---

# Slide 33

## Selection of attacks

33

Known plaintext: attacker has samples of both plaintext and its encrypted version (ciphertext) and is at liberty to make use of them to reveal further secret information such as secret keys

Chosen plaintext: attacker has the capability to choose arbitrary plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme. In the worst case, a chosen-plaintext attack could reveal the scheme's secret key

uses an oracle

---

# Slide 34

## Selection (continued)

34

Chosen ciphertext: the cryptanalyst gathers information, at least in part, by choosing a ciphertext and obtaining its decryption under an unknown key

Adaptive chosen plaintext: the cryptanalyst makes a series of interactive queries, choosing subsequent plaintexts based on the information from the previous encryptions

both use an oracle

## About brute-force

36

Modern computers can quickly try exploring all possible keys (~ 106 to 1015 keys/second)
  - depending on hardware

Keys often have a fixed size: the longer the key, the stronger the security — but the slower the performance 

If a key is n bits long, there are 2ⁿ possible keys. The practical limit for current computers is often set around n = 80, but this threshold continues to rise. With 128-bit keys, even at a rate of 1 trillion keys per second, it would take over 10¹⁹ years on average to brute-force the key

# Slide 37

## Keys and password

37

similar but different

---

# Slide 38

## Why to make a distinction?

38

Keys and passwords
They have similarities but are different
Both are secret
Cryptography uses both (for now)
They have different characteristics
They are used in different contexts
They are protected differently
They have a different impact on security

---

# Slide 39

## Password basics

39

A password is a human-chosen secret used to authenticate a user
It must be
  - Memorable
  - Short enough to type
  - Representable with keyboard characters

---

# Slide 40

## Limitations of passwords

40

Typable = predictable: constrained to the keyboard → lower entropy
Password space = Tⁿ, not Nⁿ (T: keyboard-typable symbols, N>T: all possible symbols)
Vulnerable to
  - Brute force
  - Reuse across platforms
  - Other attacks
  - 

---

# Slide 41

## Phishing attacks

41

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack in which an adversary tricks users into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or access credentials 
Characteristics
  - Disguised as legitimate emails, messages, or websites
  - Often creates urgency (e.g., “Your account will be locked!”)
  - Can lead to credential theft, financial loss, or malware installation
Email, SMS, voice calls, fake login pages etc.

# Slide 42

## What is a cryptographic key?

42

A cryptographic key is a random bit string used in encryption, decryption, and other cryptographic operations
If the string is n bits long, then there are 2ⁿ possible keys

0101011000011101…10101011

561D…AB (often represented in hexadecimal)

# Slide 43

## Key properties

43

Machine-generated
Not typable
Fixed-length (e.g., 128, 256 bits)
Stored as binary, not text

# Slide 45

## Analogy	

45

password = PIN typed into a keypad

key = the actual metal key unlocking a vault


---

# Slide 46

## Combined use

46

Many systems use passwords to unlock secret keys
Example
  - PGP, Signal, WhatsApp: your password decrypts a stored secret key

---

# Slide 47

## Key Derivation

47

Passwords are often converted into keys using "ad hoc" algorithms
  - Argon2, PBKDF2

Still constrained by password entropy

---

# Slide 48

## Why keys are more secure

48

Higher entropy

Machine-random

Not guessable or typable

---

# Slide 49

## Why passwords are still used

49

Usable by humans

Don’t require special storage

Usability vs security tradeoff

---

# Slide 50

## Summary

50

Passwords: chosen by humans, typable, used for identity
Keys: generated by machines, not typable, used for encryption
They’re not interchangeable — both must be protected appropriately
